-- Outputs a partially undefined circuit. This illustrates the use of
-- laziness in the Quipper circuit generation code.

-- Please note that currently only the ASCII backend can make actual
-- use of laziness; the graphics-based backends must generate the
-- whole circuit before it can be printed.

-- We also apply a transformer, to illustrate the laziness of
-- transformers as well.
