======================================================================

July 27, 2016: Release 0.8

 * Portability: compatibility fixes for GHC 8.0. Note: GHC 7.10 is too
   broken and will not be supported by Quipper.

October 14, 2014: Release 0.7

 * Portability: compatibility fixes for GHC 7.8.

January 16, 2014: Release 0.6

 * Minor edits and documentation updates.
 * Added a new gate gate_iX_inv
 * Added "alternate" version of synthesis algorithm, using only
   generators of determinant 1 if possible.
 * Synthesis code is now in an external package "newsynth".
 * Rendering code is now in an external package "easyrender".
 * Updated for use with fixedprec-0.2.1.0.

September 2, 2013: Release 0.5

 * Portability: compatibility fixes for GHC 7.6.2.
 * Portability: fixed Windows incompatibility bug. Handling of Ctrl-C
   may or may not work on Windows, depending on console.
 * Added quipperi script, analogous to ghci.
 * New library QuipperLib.ClassicalOptim: algebraic optimization of
   auto-generated classical circuits. Added "optimized" oracle to BWT
   algorithm.
 * QuipperLib.Decompose: Added decomposition into a "standard" gate
   set, consisting of X, Y, Z, H, S, S-dagger, T, T-dagger, and CNOT.
   Added KeepPhase flag to some transformers.
 * QuipperLib.GateDecompositions: added more gates.
 * New library Libraries.Synthesis.RotationDecomposition: implements a
   variant of the algorithm from Nielsen and Chuang to decompose an
   nxn unitary operator into one- and two-level rotations.
 * New library QuipperLib.Unboxing: unboxing transformers.
 * Updated ASCII output format; improved circuit parser efficiency.
 * Miscellaneous bug fixes: malformed W-gates, qdata_of_qubits,
   floorlog.
 * Fixed handling of iterated subroutines in depth transformer.
 * Documentation updates and minor refactoring.

June 19, 2013: Release 0.4

 * First public release.
