-- | This tool unwinds a circuit by inlining all top-level boxed
-- subroutines.  It can sometimes be used to pre-process circuits for
-- use by other tools that may not yet work correctly with boxed
-- subroutines. Note, however, that this can substantially increase
-- the size of the circuit representation.
-- 
-- Note that only top-level boxed subroutines are inlined; the tool
-- may have to be applied several times to remove all levels of boxes.
-- 
-- This is only an illustration for how to write such tools; another
-- tool could be written that does \"deep\" unboxing.
