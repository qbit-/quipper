-- | Low-level quantum circuit implementation. This is our backend
-- implementation of quantum circuits. Note: there is no run-time
-- error checking at the moment. 
-- 
-- At its heart, a circuit is a list of gates. All well-definedness
-- checking (e.g. input arity, output arity, and checking that the
-- intermediate gates are connected to legitimate wires) is done
-- dynamically, at circuit generation time, and is not stored within
-- the circuit itself. This allows circuits to be produced and
-- consumed lazily.
-- 
-- Implementation note: this file is in the intermediate stage of a
-- code refactoring, and should be considered \"under renovation\".

-- | A signed item of type /a/. 'Signed' /x/ 'True' represents a
-- positive item, and 'Signed' /x/ 'False' represents a negative item.

-- * The ReadWrite monad

-- $ The 'ReadWrite' monad encapsulates the interaction with a (real
-- or simulated) low-level quantum device.

-- | The 'ReadWrite' monad describes a standard read-write computation,
-- here specialized to the case where writes are 'Gate's, prompts are
-- 'Bit's, and reads are 'Bool's. Thus, a read-write computation can
-- do three things:
-- 
-- * terminate with a result. This is the case 'RW_Return'.
-- 
-- * write a single 'Gate' and continue. This is the case 'RW_Write'.
-- 
-- * issue a prompt, which is a 'Wire', then read a 'Bool', then
-- continue. This is the case 'RW_Read'.
