-- * Simulation as a Transformer

-- $ The quantum simulator takes a Quipper circuit producing function,
-- and uses a transformer to simulate the resulting circuit, one gate at a time.
-- This allows the simulation to progress in a lazy manner, allowing dynamic
-- lifting results to be passed back to the circuit producing function as
-- and when they are required (to generate further gates in the circuit).

-- $ The implementation of the quantum simulator makes use of a /State/ monad
-- to carry an underlying quantum state throughout the computation. This /State/
-- is updated by each quantum operation within the circuit. A quantum
-- state is a vector of 'basis' states, along with complex amplitudes.

-- | Gates that act on a single qubit can be defined by essentially a 2-by-2 matrix.
-- A GateR is written by rows, such that a matrix:
--
-- \[image GateR.png] 
--
-- would be written as (m00,m01,m10,m11).
type GateR r = (Cplx r,Cplx r, Cplx r, Cplx r)

-- | Scalar multiplication of a 2-by-2 matrix by a given scalar.
scale :: (Floating r) => Cplx r -> GateR r -> GateR r
scale e (a,b,c,d) = (e*a,e*b,e*c,e*d) 

-- | The inverse of a 'GateR' is its conjugate transpose.
reverseR :: (Floating r) => GateR r -> GateR r
reverseR (m00,m01,m10,m11) = (conjugate m00, conjugate m10, conjugate m01, conjugate m11)
 where
  conjugate (Cplx a b) = Cplx a (-b) 

-- | A simple pattern matching function that gives each \"gate name\"
-- a /GateR/ representation.  Adding (single qubit) quantum gates to
-- this function will give them an implementation in the
-- simulator. Any single qubit named quantum gate that needs to be
-- simulated must have a clause in this function, along with a given
-- /GateR/ that is its matrix representation. Note that unitarity is
-- not enforced, so defined gates must be checked manually to be
-- unitary operators.
