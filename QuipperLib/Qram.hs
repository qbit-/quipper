-- | A custom qRAM algorithm for fetching and storing quantum data
-- from a quantum array, addressed by a quantum integer.

module QuipperLib.Qram (
  indexed_access,
  indexed_fetch_at,
  indexed_store_at,
  indexed_swap_at,
  ) where

import Quipper
import QuipperLib.Arith

-- | Inputs a list /a/ of quantum data and a quantum integer /i/, and
-- returns the /i/th element of /a/. This is done with controlled swap
-- operations, but without ancillas, i.e., the output is the only copy
-- of that quantum data. Note that the remaining elements of the array
-- may be swapped around, so they are not useable until
-- 'indexed_access' has been reversed.
-- 
-- Suggested usage:
-- 
-- > with_computed (indexed_access i a) $ \x -> do
-- >   <<<operate on x>>>
-- 
-- If the index is out of bound, return an unpredictable element of
-- /a/. If /a/ is of length 0, raise an error.
