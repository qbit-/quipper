                 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ON WINDOWS

             Benoit Valiron <benoit.valiron@monoidal.net>


I. Introduction
   ============

We have tested the installation on a Lenovo Thinkpad X220 with Windows
7 Professional, Service Pack 1. Other configurations will likely also
work.  Please note that version numbers of software listed below
reflects the versions that we used for testing. Other versions
(especially newer ones) will likely also work. 

Prerequisites. The following tools are needed for Quipper to compile
and run:

 * The Glasgow Haskell Compiler (ghc), v.7.6.2
   Vendor: The University Court of the University of Glasgow.

 * cabal.exe v.0.14.0
   Prepackaged with ghc.
   Vendor: The University Court of the University of Glasgow.

 * The bundle of POSIX tools in MSYS v.1.0.11. In particular:
      bash v.3.1.17 (original vendor: Free Software Foundation)
      make v.3.81 (original vendor: Free Software Foundation)
      sed v.4.2.1 (original vendor: Free Software Foundation)
      gawk v.3.1.7 (original vendor: Free Software Foundation)
   Vendor: MSYS.org

 * Acrobat Reader v.11.0
   Vendor: Adobe


Under Windows, the software development environment consists of

 * A Windows operating system:
   Microsoft Windows 7 x64
   Vendor: Microsoft

 * The DOS command line 
   cmd.exe, v.6.1.7601

 * A text editor, e.g.
   Notepad v.6.1, bundled with Windows 7
   Vendor: Microsoft

 * A web browser for reading the documentation, e.g.
   Firefox v.17
   Vendor: Mozilla Foundation

Note that the above components are sufficient to create, debug, and
assemble/compile/interpret the original source code of Quipper and the
accompanying libraries, algorithm implementations, and other
accompanying programs.


Optionally, you can use the Emacs text editor, and the optional
Haskell mode for Emacs:

 * Emacs v.2.24.2
   Vendor: Free Software Foundation

 * haskell-mode for emacs, v.2.8.0
   Vendor: Free Software Foundation


In the following, we'll go step by step on installing the compilation
tools, and we briefly mention how to configure the optional Emacs
interface.


II. Installation
    ============

1. GHC
   ---

General webpage: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/

Direct link for download: 
http://www.haskell.org/ghc/dist/7.6.2/ghc-7.6.2-i386-unknown-mingw32.tar.bz2

You can change the default path for installation, but you must choose
a path name that does not contain any white space characters.

Otherwise, just keep the defaults.


2. cabal.exe
   ---------

General webpage: http://www.haskell.org/cabal/download.html

Direct link for download:
http://www.haskell.org/cabal/release/cabal-install-0.10.2/cabal.exe

Download it and place it in the bin directory the ghc installation
path. E.g., if you stayed with the default place it in

      c:\ghc\ghc-7.6.2\bin

Test that everything went well by going to the 

task bar -> all programs -> GHC -> 7.6.2 -> ghci

and make sure you get a prompt.


3. Acrobat Reader
   --------------

You probably already have that one, but just in case:
http://get.adobe.com/reader/


4. POSIX tools
   -----------

a. Download and installation
   .........................

For these, I suggest MSYS.
Webpage:
http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MSYS

Direct download:
http://downloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/MSYS-1.0.11.exe

The installation proposes c:\msys\1.0 as the installation directory;
this is a good choice. If you change it, again I suggest using a path
name that does not contain any white space characters.

A post-installation script performs some checks. When prompted, answer
saying you do not have MinGW.


b. Update of the PATH variable
   ...........................

Go in the system properties, select advanced -> environment variables
(at the bottom) -> edit the user variable PATH by adding at the end
 
   ;c:\msys\1.0\bin

Note: Now, there should be msys in your path.


c. Check
   .....

Open a console and type "sh --login -i". You should see a new prompt. Type
"make". You should see the message "make *** no targets specified"

You can also use the bat file c:\msys\1.0\msys.bat.

I'll refer to this shell as the msys-shell.



d. (OPTIONAL) Configure to use with Emacs
   ......................................

In Emacs, open ~/.profile and write the following:

    export PS1="\n\w\n\u@\h $ "

It will set the prompt to black-and-white, more manageable by
Emacs. \w is the working directory, \u is the user name and \h the
name of the machine. \n is the new line.

Now, instead of the console you can use the emacs command "M-x shell"
and run

  sh --login -i

inside if you prefer.




5. (OPTIONAL) Haskell Mode
   -----------------------

Webpage: http://projects.haskell.org/haskellmode-emacs/
Direct download link:
http://projects.haskell.org/haskellmode-emacs/haskell-mode-2.8.0.tar.gz

Uncompress the tarball, for example with 7zip v.9.20 (vendor: 7-zip.org),
and you should have a directory "haskell-mode-2.8.0".

Move it to a directory of lisp files, for example .emacs.d/lisp/, or
to the directory site-lisp of your emacs directory structure.

Then open your init file (for example, ~/.emacs), and place the
following in it:

   (load "PATH_TO_HASKELL_MODE/haskell-site-file")

   (add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook
          '(lambda ()
             (local-set-key "\C-c\C-c" 'compile)))

The first line sets up the coloring.  The second line is to remap
C-cC-c to the default compilation mode (the haskell mode has a
different, but bad, idea: it remaps it to the interpreter).

Now, when you open any ".hs" file in Emacs, it should automatically be
colored according to syntactic classes.



III. Configuration of GHC for compiling Quipper
     ==========================================

In the msys-shell, perform the following:

cabal update

then:

cabal install random
cabal install mtl
cabal install primes
cabal install Lattices
cabal install zlib
cabal install easyrender
cabal install fixedprec
cabal install newsynth
cabal install containers
cabal install set-monad
cabal install QuickCheck

Please note: "Lattices" must be capitalized. You now have all the
necessary Haskell libraries.

Note: When upgrading from a previous version of Quipper, please ensure
that the fixedprec library is version 0.2.1.0 or newer; Quipper 0.6
will not work with earlier versions of fixedprec. Also ensure that the
newsynth library has been compiled against the same version of
fixedprec as Quipper. If you get strange error messages related to
fixedprec, try

cabal install fixedprec 
cabal install newsynth --reinstall

If you go (with the command cd) to the directory where you unzipped
Quipper, you can run the command "make" and it should produce an
executable file in each Algorithm subdirectory.

IV. Auxiliary files
    ===============

Quipper has a "preview" function for visualizing circuits in PDF. For
it to work, one needs to place the batch file acroread.bat (located in
the "scripts" directory) somewhere in the PATH, for example in
c:\msys\1.0\bin.

There is also a batch file quipper.bat for compiling Quipper
programs. For convenience, one can add the scripts directory to the
PATH to easily use them. If you move the batch files around, make sure
to move the other scripts to the same directory as the batch files,
and to update QUIPPER_BASE in the "quipper" and "quipperi" scripts to
point to the directory where the Quipper sources are located.

V. Further Instructions
   ====================

Continue with the instructions in the file "README".
